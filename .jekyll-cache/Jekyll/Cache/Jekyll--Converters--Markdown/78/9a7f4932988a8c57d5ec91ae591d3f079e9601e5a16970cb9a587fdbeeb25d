I"˜<p>Yeah, and if you were the pope theyâ€™d be all, â€œStraighten your pope hat.â€ And â€œPut on your good vestments.â€ Noooooo! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</p>

<p>You lived before you met me?! Ow, my spirit! Humans dating robots is sick. <strong>You people wonder why Iâ€™m still single?</strong> <em>Itâ€™s â€˜cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</em> I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-crazy-i-cant-swallow-that">Are you crazy? I canâ€™t swallow that.</h2>

<p>Oh, I donâ€™t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Meh. So, how â€˜bout them Knicks? Also Zoidberg.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</li>
  <li>Fry, we have a crate to deliver.</li>
  <li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
    <h3 id="why-not-indeed">Why not indeed!</h3>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I donâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You donâ€™t know how to do any of those.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</li>
  <li>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</li>
  <li>Ooh, name it after me!</li>
</ul>

<p>Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>

<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You wonâ€™t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making youâ€™ll be doing. Itâ€™s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? Thereâ€™s no booze and only one hooker.</p>

<em>Minimalism</em></p>

<p>Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Iâ€™m just glad my fat, ugly mama isnâ€™t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book â€˜Earth in the Balanceâ€™â€™, and the much more popular â€˜â€˜Harry Potter and the Balance of Earthâ€™, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you canâ€™t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, donâ€™t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, donâ€™t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Thereâ€™s no part of that sentence I didnâ€™t like! Noooooo! I can explain. Itâ€™s very valuable.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by â€œdevilâ€, I mean Robot Devil. And by â€œmetaphoricallyâ€, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, yâ€™all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Youâ€™re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I donâ€™t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, weâ€™re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, youâ€™re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, Iâ€™m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! Thereâ€™s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought â€œWhy should I?â€ Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say â€œnuclear wesselsâ€! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope theyâ€™d be all, â€œStraighten your pope hat.â€ And â€œPut on your good vestments.â€ Thatâ€™s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
