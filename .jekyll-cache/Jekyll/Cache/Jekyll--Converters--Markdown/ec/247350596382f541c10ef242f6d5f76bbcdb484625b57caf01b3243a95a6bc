<h5 id="what-does-grc-do">What does GRC do?</h5>

<p>GRC is a structured tool to align IT with business goals while managing risks and meeting all industry and government compliance requirements.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-the-user-need">What is the user need?</h5>

<p>Over 10 years, Amazonians have been using GRC 1.0 which looks like this:

The biggest problems here include but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>No visibility of the aggregated status of users' personal items (processes/applications/controls/reviews/...) in the platform.</li>
<li>No risk library, which is the center piece that connects all the items. </li>
<li>UI is tech-heavy, and hard to use for general users. </li>
</ul>

<p>Long story short, GRC 1.0 is nothing more than a recording</p>

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I donâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You donâ€™t know how to do any of those.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</li>
  <li>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</li>
  <li>Ooh, name it after me!</li>
</ul>

<p>Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>

<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You wonâ€™t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making youâ€™ll be doing. Itâ€™s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? Thereâ€™s no booze and only one hooker.</p>

<p>Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Iâ€™m just glad my fat, ugly mama isnâ€™t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book â€˜Earth in the Balanceâ€™â€™, and the much more popular â€˜â€˜Harry Potter and the Balance of Earthâ€™, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you canâ€™t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, donâ€™t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, donâ€™t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Thereâ€™s no part of that sentence I didnâ€™t like! Noooooo! I can explain. Itâ€™s very valuable.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by â€œdevilâ€, I mean Robot Devil. And by â€œmetaphoricallyâ€, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, yâ€™all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Youâ€™re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I donâ€™t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, weâ€™re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, youâ€™re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, Iâ€™m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! Thereâ€™s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought â€œWhy should I?â€ Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say â€œnuclear wesselsâ€! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope theyâ€™d be all, â€œStraighten your pope hat.â€ And â€œPut on your good vestments.â€ Thatâ€™s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
