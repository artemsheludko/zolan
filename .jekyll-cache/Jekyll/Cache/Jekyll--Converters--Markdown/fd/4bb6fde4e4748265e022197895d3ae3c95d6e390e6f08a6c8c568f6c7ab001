<h5 id="what-does-grc-do">What does GRC do?</h5>

<p>GRC is a structured tool to align IT with business goals while managing risks and meeting all industry and government compliance requirements.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-the-user-need">What is the user need?</h5>

<p>Over 10 years, Amazonians have been using GRC 1.0 which looks like this:

The biggest problems here include but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>No visibility of the aggregated status of users' personal items (processes/applications/controls/reviews/...) in GRC.</li>
<li>No risk library, which is the reason why controls exists. </li>
<li>UI is tech-heavy, and hard to use for general users. </li>
</ul>

<p>Long story short, GRC 1.0 is nothing more than a recording</p>

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I don’t ‘need’ to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You don’t know how to do any of those.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</li>
  <li>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</li>
  <li>Ooh, name it after me!</li>
</ul>

<p>Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys aren’t Santa! You’re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Who’s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>

<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You won’t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you’ll be doing. It’s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? There’s no booze and only one hooker.</p>

<p>Ummm…to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I’m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn’t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ‘Earth in the Balance’’, and the much more popular ‘‘Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth’, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you can’t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, don’t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don’t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! I’m Santa Claus! There’s no part of that sentence I didn’t like! Noooooo! I can explain. It’s very valuable.</p>

<p>I’m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who’s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys aren’t Santa! You’re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by “devil”, I mean Robot Devil. And by “metaphorically”, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, y’all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You’re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I don’t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, we’re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, you’re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, I’m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! There’s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought “Why should I?” Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say “nuclear wessels”! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope they’d be all, “Straighten your pope hat.” And “Put on your good vestments.” That’s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
