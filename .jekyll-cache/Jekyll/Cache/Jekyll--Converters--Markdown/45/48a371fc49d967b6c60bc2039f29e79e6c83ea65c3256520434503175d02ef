<p>GRC 2(Governance, Risk and Compliance) is the 1st and the only risk management tool in Amazon, with all 1,541,000 employees as its potential users.</p>

<p>GRC 2â€™s existing users include Global Financial Risk Controls (GFRC) team, policy creators and owners across Amazon, CDO Infosec, AWS Security, AWS Managed Services, Internal Audit and risk teams.</p>

<p>Amazon leadership (VP and directors) also rely heavily on GRC 2 to do periodicly reviews.</p>

<p>My Role: the only designer and lead researcher of the project.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>

<h5 id="what-does-grc-do">What does GRC do?</h5>

<p>GRC is a structured tool to align IT with business goals while managing risks and meeting all industry and government compliance requirements.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-the-user-need">What is the user need?</h5>

<p>Over 10 years, Amazonians have been using GRC 1.0 which looks like this:

<p>The biggest problems here include but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>No visibility on the aggregated status of users' personal items (processes/applications/controls/reviews/...) in GRC.</li>
<li>No risk library, which is the reason why controls exists. </li>
<li>UI is tech-heavy, and not friendly to non-tech users (including leadership). </li>
</ul>

<p>Long story short, GRC 1.0 is nothing more than a recording tool of usersâ€™ personal items, and cannot provide extra insights/convenience.</p>

<h3 id="research-no-one-knows-it-all">Research: No One Knows It All.</h3>

<p>The scope of GRC is extremely broad, which covers both internal and external risks and auditing flows. Not too surprisingly, we soon found out: no one knows it all-most users only interact with a small part of GRC, and no teammate (PM or SDE) has the comprehensive understanding of all the user flows. Based on this finding, we decided to divide and conquer. Our plan pivoted to: start with one customer-GFRC(Global Financial Risk Controls) team on their financial auditing flow, and then spread the success and scope to other users.</p>

<p>After:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 hours of interviews</li>
<li>10+ interviewees </li>
<li>4 weeks of research</li>
<li>2 Rounds of workshops with customers </li>
</ul>
<p>We were able to map out 4 user journeys for main personas:</p>

<p><img src="/portfolio2023.github.io/images/creatorflow.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Based on these flow, we were able to move to the design phase.

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I donâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You donâ€™t know how to do any of those.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</li>
  <li>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</li>
  <li>Ooh, name it after me!</li>
</ul>

<p>Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>

<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You wonâ€™t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making youâ€™ll be doing. Itâ€™s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? Thereâ€™s no booze and only one hooker.</p>

<p>Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Iâ€™m just glad my fat, ugly mama isnâ€™t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book â€˜Earth in the Balanceâ€™â€™, and the much more popular â€˜â€˜Harry Potter and the Balance of Earthâ€™, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you canâ€™t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, donâ€™t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, donâ€™t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Thereâ€™s no part of that sentence I didnâ€™t like! Noooooo! I can explain. Itâ€™s very valuable.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by â€œdevilâ€, I mean Robot Devil. And by â€œmetaphoricallyâ€, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, yâ€™all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Youâ€™re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I donâ€™t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, weâ€™re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, youâ€™re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, Iâ€™m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! Thereâ€™s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought â€œWhy should I?â€ Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say â€œnuclear wesselsâ€! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope theyâ€™d be all, â€œStraighten your pope hat.â€ And â€œPut on your good vestments.â€ Thatâ€™s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
